# Ari Gilgur's Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Projects

### [Echo-AI Watchdog](https://github.com/AriGilgur/streamlit)
I built a dashboard for iCardio.ai that scrapes PubMed and arXiv for articles that contain key words. it updates weekly and saves past weeks articles. I used Streamlit, Google Colab, GitHub and ChatGPT. I learned how to use all of these sites. I learned how to write prompts for ChatGPT and how to use the code for the sites.

### [Echo-Scout Agent](https://github.com/AriGilgur/echo_ai_agent)
I Developed a fully automated pipeline for iCardio.ai that fetches and summarizes the latest research papers on echocardiography and artificial intelligence from PubMed and arXiv, and delivers a weekly HTML email digest to clinical researchers, using GitHub, OpenAI, and SendGrid. i learned how to use API keys, GitHub actions/workflows, and Python.

### [MNIST-Digit-Recognizer](https://github.com/AriGilgur/mnist-digit-recognizer.git)
I built a web app that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) drawn by users using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Built with PyTorch and Streamlit for easy interaction and real-time predictions.
