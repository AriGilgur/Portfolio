# Ari Gilgur's Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Projects

### [Echo-AI Watchdog](https://github.com/AriGilgur/streamlit)
I built a dashboard for iCardio.ai that scrapes PubMed and arXiv for articles that contain key words. it updates weekly and saves past weeks articles. I used Streamlit, Google Colab, GitHub and ChatGPT. I learned how to use all of these sites. I learned how to write prompts for ChatGPT and how to use the code for the sites.

### [Echo-Scout Agent](https://github.com/AriGilgur/echo_ai_agent)
I Developed a fully automated pipeline for iCardio.ai that fetches and summarizes the latest research papers on echocardiography and artificial intelligence from PubMed and arXiv, and delivers a weekly HTML email digest to clinical researchers, using GitHub, OpenAI, and SendGrid. i learned how to use API keys, GitHub actions/workflows, and Python.

### [MNIST-Digit-Recognizer](https://github.com/AriGilgur/mnist-digit-recognizer.git)
I built a web app that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) drawn by users using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Built with PyTorch and Streamlit for easy interaction and real-time predictions.


### [Dream-Cook-Agent](https://github.com/AriGilgur/mnist-digit-recognizer.git)
I developed a fully automated TikTok content generator that creates short cooking videos based on randomly selected ingredients. The system uses OpenAI to generate 3-step recipes with engaging titles, captions, and voiceovers, while MoviePy and Pillow handle video editing and text overlays. I learned how to integrate generative AI into media workflows, manage API-based assets, and build end-to-end automation in Python.

### Summer Internship Reflection â€“ iCardio.AI
This summer, I interned at iCardio.AI, where I worked on projects that combined artificial intelligence with clinical research in echocardiography. I built tools that automatically collected and summarized new research papers, created a dashboard to track weekly articles, and developed a system that sent research updates to doctors by email. Through these projects, I learned how to use APIs, GitHub workflows, and Python to create real working tools. I also gained experience with OpenAI models and saw how automation can save time for researchers. Overall, this internship gave me the chance to apply programming skills to real-world problems in healthcare and helped me understand how AI can be used in medicine.
