# Ari Gilgur's Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Projects

### [Echo-AI Watchdog](https://github.com/AriGilgur/streamlit)
I built a dashboard for iCardio.ai that scrapes PubMed and arXiv for articles that contain key words. it updates weekly and saves past weeks articles. I used Streamlit, Google Colab, GitHub and ChatGPT. I learned how to use all of these sites. I learned how to write prompts for ChatGPT and how to use the code for the sites.
